An Uber-like webapp in Ruby on Rails.

Just login with your Uber account and estimate prices and duration of Uber rides.

Then, just request a ride and follow your booking until the drop off.

Developed during Le Wagon bootcamp, August 2016, in order to test a part of the final project (A chatbot to book uber rides via text messages).
